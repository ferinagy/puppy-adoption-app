## :scroll: Description

The app fetches the list of animals that can be adopted from https://www.petfinder.com api. Then it shows list of 
animals, their details and can open a website with adoption options.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Interesting part is that it uses real data. Also there is some simple filtering logic based on toggling favorites that 
helped me to learn a bit about handling state with jetpack compose.
